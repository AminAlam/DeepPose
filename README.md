# DeepPose

### What is this?
This is a Deep Neural Network which can detect human joints from a picture. This model has been made by tensoeflow and is trained by 3600 images. It was one of the home works of SUT Deep Learning course.

### Dependencies
- Tensorflow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- pickle
- cv2
- keras.models
- scipy.io



### Data Augmentation
I have augmented the training set by fliping each image.
